    body: `Before AI, before citations, before anything — your technical health determines whether Google and AI crawlers can even understand your site. Core Web Vitals (LCP under 2.5 s, CLS under 0.1, INP under 200 ms), clean crawl paths, proper canonical tags, and a schema-rich HTML structure are non-negotiable in 2026. A shaky foundation means none of the steps above it will stick. SkillStack audits every site for over 80 technical signals before writing a single word of content.`,

    n: "02",
    title: "AI Overviews Appear",
    body: `Google launched AI Overviews (AIO) globally in 2024. By 2026, they appear in the majority of informational and commercial queries. AIO pulls a synthesised answer from three to five sources — appearing above the #1 organic result. This means a page ranked #7 with excellent structure can receive more clicks than the #1 result without AIO inclusion. The goal shifts from "rank first" to "be cited first."`,

  },
  {
    n: "03",
    title: "Structure for AI",
    body: `AI systems — whether Google's Gemini or OpenAI's GPT-4o — build knowledge graphs from structured data. JSON-LD schema markup (Organization, Article, FAQPage, HowTo, BreadcrumbList, Person, LocalBusiness) tells AI exactly what your entities are, how they relate, and why they are authoritative. Entity disambiguation — making clear that "SkillStack" is a company, not a concept — is especially critical for brand queries and AI Overview inclusion.`,
    accent: "slate",
  },
  {
    n: "04",
    title: "Optimise for AEO",
    body: `Answer Engine Optimisation (AEO) targets the AI layer directly. This means writing content in a question-and-answer format, adding FAQPage and HowTo schema, using speakable markup for voice answers, and structuring each page around a single primary query. In 2026, the content that gets cited by ChatGPT or Perplexity is content written specifically to answer — not just to rank. SkillStack's content team writes every article with AEO structure from the first draft.`,
    accent: "teal",
  },
  {
    n: "05",
    title: "ChatGPT · Perplexity · Gemini",
    body: `Users have shifted a significant portion of informational queries away from Google entirely — toward ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google Gemini. These tools pull answers from indexed, trusted sources. A brand that is not cited in these AI responses is invisible to a growing share of the search market. Optimising for these platforms requires clean indexability, strong backlink authority, and content that directly addresses queries these tools receive most often.`,

    title: "Earn Citations",
    body: `An AI citation is a reference — linked or unlinked — from a high-authority publication, directory, or AI response. Earning citations requires a combination of digital PR, guest content on reputable domains, and being mentioned in AI-trusted sources. Citations are the currency of 2026 SEO: they tell both Google and AI assistants that your content is verifiable and worth surfacing. A single citation from a site like Dawn.pk or ProPakistani.pk carries far more weight than ten low-quality backlinks.`,

    body: `Google's Natural Language Processing can now identify brand mentions without anchor text. A mention of "SkillStack" in a relevant article — even without a link — contributes to the entity's authority. Building brand mentions requires a systematic outreach strategy: press features, podcast appearances, community mentions, and social signals. SkillStack tracks brand mentions across the web and actively builds the off-site authority that AI systems and Google use to gauge trustworthiness.`,

    body: `The final state of 2026 SEO is dual visibility: appearing in traditional Google rankings and being cited in AI answers simultaneously. Brands that achieve this receive organic traffic from two sources — the 60% of users who still click organic results and the growing segment who act on AI-cited recommendations. SkillStack's packages are designed to deliver this dual outcome, not one or the other.`,

                For years, the SEO playbook was simple: research keywords, publish content,
                build backlinks, watch rankings climb, collect clicks. That linear path still
                forms the <strong>bedrock</strong> of search — but it&apos;s no longer the ceiling.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2026, Google&apos;s AI Overviews appear on the majority of queries. ChatGPT
                fields over 100 million daily queries. Perplexity is growing 10x year over year.
                Users don&apos;t just search — they <em>ask</em>. And the answers they receive come
                from a handful of cited, structured, AI-trusted sources.
              </p>
              <p>
                The brands that succeed in 2026 are not the ones who rank #1 and stop there.
                They are the ones who <strong>rank on Google and get cited in every AI answer</strong>.
                This guide walks through each step of how that actually works — and how SkillStack
                builds for all eight simultaneously.
